          <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
            local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
            originally included cues for its appearance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="css" class="con">
          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
            markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such
            as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of
            the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
            presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
            separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation
            needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification
            of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to
            share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
            file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
            content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
            load speed between the pages that share the file and its
            formatting.

        <div id="js" class="con">
          <h3>JS</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
            core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As
            of 2024, 98.9% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
            webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
            execute the code on users' devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
            that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic
            typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
            functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
            functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
            regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
            Object Model (DOM).

        <div id="react" class="con">
          <h3>React</h3>
          <p>
            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and
            open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
            interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly
            Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

        </div>
        <div id="node" class="con">
          <h3>Node</h3>
          <p>
            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
            environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
            Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools
            and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code
            on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content
            before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently,
            Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying
            web-application development around a single programming language,
            as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus
            client-side programming.
